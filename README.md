# 🧠 F.R.I.D.A.Y. - Your Personal AI Assistant

This is a Python-based AI assistant inspired by *Jarvis* and *Friday*, capable of:

- 🔍 Searching the web  
- 🌤️ Weather checking
- 📨 Sending Emails 
- 📷 Vision through camera (Web app)
- 🗣️ Speech
- 📝 Chat (Web app) 

This agent uses LiveKit. 
And I modified it from J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) to 
  **F.R.I.D.A.Y.(Female Robotic Interface Delivering Assistance to You😉)**

- you can use [LiveKit Playground](https://agents-playground.livekit.io/#cam=1&mic=1&screen=1&video=1&audio=1&chat=1&theme_color=green) for an interactive UI.
